        </p>
        <strong>Solo travelers</strong>
        <p>
            Our prices are based on full occupancy of the boats, therefore it's financially impossible for solo travelers to occupy a double cabin at the per person rate.  Depending on availability, we may be able to sleep you in the single bunks, alternatively you will pay the cabin price with a €100 discount.
        </p>

        <strong>Private Charter</strong>
        <p>
            For a private charter outside our fleet:<br>
            Security deposit - With all private charters, guests will be required to leave a security deposit at the charter company base. The amount will be blocked and released without charge when the boat completes 'check out' without any damages.  If there are damages caused by the skipper, the skipper's insurance will cover the damage costs.  Amounts blocked will range from €2,000 to €5,000 depending on the boat.  This amount may be larger depending on the value of the boat chartered. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For a private charter which is outside of our scheduled publicly advertised voyages, we will be required to charter an additional boat(s) and crew.  As the boats and crew are not under the management of Med Sailing Holidays, we cannot guarantee the condition of the boat, nor be held responsible for a poor maintained vessel. Furthermore we cannot be held responsible for the demeanor of a local contract skipper. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If you cancel a private charter and we have chartered a boat outside of our fleet, we will try to recover your deposit however if the charter company imposes a penalty, these will be at your expense not ours. 
        </p>
        <strong>Fuel allowance on private charter</strong>
        <p>
            There is a fuel allowance of €150 for a 7 day private charter on a mono hull and €200 on a catamaran. Diesel costs can run over this amount when excessively using the generator and air conditioning.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you wish to change the itinerary on a private charter, this is at the discretion of the skipper. Any additional costs that come from a change in itinerary, such as berthing costs will be paid by the guests. If there is a change to the itinerary, it's expected that guests take the crew for dinner.
        </p>
        <strong>Linen</strong>
        <p>
            One set of linen will supplied for everyone on board, including towel and hand towel. We will also provide bed sheets (top and bottom), pillow, pillow case and blanket. Beach towels are not provided.
        </p>
        <p>
            If extra linen is required, please give us at least two weeks noticed, otherwise we may not have time to make the arrangements. There is an additional charge for extra linen and for resetting your bed linen.
        </p>
        <strong>Water toys</strong>
        <p>
            A basic set of snorkeling gear is provided on each boat. Due to guest damages, there may be more complete sets on one boat than another. There will be a minimum of 2 sets on each boat. We aim to provide a minimum of 2 sets per cabin. If you want to guarantee a set, we suggest you pack your own.
        </p>
        <p>
            Floaties are not provided as standard equipment. Some boats may have more than others. If you'd like floaties, we sugest you bring your own.
        </p>
        <strong>Gratuities</strong>
        <p>
            Gratuities are not included in the price of the charter.  The MYBA (Mediterranean Yacht Brokers Association) issued tipping policy guidelines that range from 5% to 15% of your total charter price as the customary range.
        </p>
        <strong>Itinerary</strong>
        <p>
            Our skippers will follow the itinerary, however there may be circumstances out of their control where this may not be possible.  The skipper has authority to change the itinerary when and where he/she deems fit.  These will be for safety reasons or adverse weather conditions.  Dangerous winds may dictate we take another marina/port/berth to the listed itinerary. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If the group collectively requests a change to the itinerary, the decision to do so will be at the skipper’s discretion.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are some ports which we berth on a restaurant's dock. It's customary that we eat in their restaurant, as they're providing a secure berth for the evening. It's also customary the restaurant provides a basic 'crew meal' for the crew.  If you don't want to eat in the restaurant, we will be forced to leave the dock. If there are additional berthing fees, these will be passed onto you and you will pay for the crew dinner.

            The boats in Med Sailing Holidays' fleet are fully serviced and maintained on an annual basis and also conduct running servicing throughout the season to keep everything in working order.  In the event of emergency repairs during your itinerary, it may be the case that we spend an extra day in a particular location.  Although this is unforeseen and unpreventable, there will be no monetary compensation for a change in the itinerary, it means you get an extra day to enjoy that stop.  The skipper will discuss options with the group and come to an decision about how to make up the time.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the winds are in excess / forecast to be in excess of 25 knots, the boat(s) must find shelter and are not permitted to leave the safety of the marina / harbour / bay.  This will result in a change in the itinerary.  We will always put your safety first, even if this means a change to your itinerary. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The itinerary is a proposed itinerary and if the weather doesn't allow for safe passage, it may result in a changed itinerary, including staying in port. Any additional water taxi's / ferries to continue to a proposed port is the financial responsibilty of the guest.

            <li>Notifying your skipper if you cannot swim or suffer from any medical conditions including but not limited to panic attacks, diabetes, heart condition, black outs or epilepsy,</li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            It is your responsibility to check you have all your possessions before you disembark the yacht. If you leave any personal items behind on the boat(s), you will need to contact the boat crew ASAP. If you notify us later than 24 hours after your trip ending, there is a high probability your items have been considered trash you have abandoned and thrown out by the cleaners.  
        </p>
        <p>
            We are not responsible for any items lost or left behind.  
        </p>
        <p>
            If you locate any forgotten items, you will be required to pay for registered post to have the items sent back to you. We are not responsible for any items that fail to arrive in the post.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pets are not permitted on board the yacht.
        </p>
        <p>
            Children under the age of 18 are not permitted on board the yacht unless you charter the boat for the week, or if you get the express consent from Med Sailing Holidays CY Ltd before time of booking.
        </p>
        <strong>Additional costs</strong>
        <p>
            If you plan on taking a water taxi to another island, these costs will be borne by you.  Once the yacht has taken a berth/mooring/anchor it will not be used as transport to nearby islands.  

            Guests are required to pay for any cave entry fees or other off-boat excursions.

            You may request a list of additional extras, which include but are not limited to: additional linen, stand up paddle board, drone video and photos (where available), request dinner on board, additional cleaning notably after children.

            The crew are there to maintain a general standard of cleanliness and are not cleaners. If it's deemed that guests are excessively soiling the boat, the skipper will raise it and if it continues to happen we will impose a €200 cleaning fee.
        </p>
        <strong>Damages and unforeseen costs</strong>
        <p>
            There are a few rules to follow while on your holiday, most of which will be covered by your skipper for a smooth trip.
            There are a few rules that must be adhered to and it’s important we bring it to your attention before your trip to minimise the possibility of things going wrong and attracting unforeseen charges. 
        </p>
        <p>
            While in a marina, you are not permitted to use your head (toilet), you should use the marina’s facilities.  If you pump the head into the marina water, the skipper may be fined for this.  This charge will be passed onto you.
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>Absolutely no personal hygiene products are to be pumped through the toilet.</u>  Any blockages of marina toilets are charged to the guest at €250 per toilet blocked. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s important to arrive at the marina at the specified time for your check in.  If the boat leaves the marina late, the skipper is likely to be charged for another full day.  The marina doesn’t make any allowances for late arrivals and our late departure.  This charge will be passed onto you. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If there are any damages made to the boat or broken inventory, these charges will be passed onto you.
        </p>
        <strong>Boats</strong>
        <p>
            As we have a growing fleet, boats/yachts may vary from time to time and may be different to those in our photos.  We reserve the right to replace/swap boats at the last minute due to unforeseen circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
            For private charters and special requests, we may outsource and use third parties for the fulfilment of a charter.
        </p>
        <strong>Changes</strong>
        <p>
            We reserve the right to amend these terms and conditions at any time, without notice to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            We reserve the right to change the pricing structure of our tours without notice.
        </p>
        <p>
            We reserve the right to change any part of the itinerary, whether we published the amends online or not. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If there are not enough bookings on an experienced-based trip (Yoga, Pride, Wine, Fitness) we reserve the right to combine boats and/or experiences, which may or may not alter the proposed itinerary.
